Privacy Policy for <App Name>

Summary

We do not collect, store, or sell personal data.

The app processes everything on your device.

We don’t use third-party analytics, advertising SDKs, or tracking technologies.

Apple may collect crash logs and diagnostics if you opt in at the system level.

This policy explains what we do (and don’t do) with data when you use <App Name>.

Who we are

Controller: <Your legal name or company> (“we”, “us”).
Contact: <postal address (optional)>, <email>.

Data we handle

We designed the app so that no personal data leaves your device. Specifically:

No account or sign-in.

No server calls to our systems for user data.

No tracking across apps or websites.

No precise location, contacts, photos, microphone, or camera unless you explicitly use a feature that needs it (and then it’s used only on-device).

Platform diagnostics (optional)

If you’ve enabled Share iPhone & Watch Analytics in iOS settings, Apple may send us aggregated, anonymized crash/usage information through App Store Connect. We can’t identify you from these reports. Learn more in Apple’s privacy policy.

App permissions

If the app requests a permission (e.g., Photos, Microphone), it’s only to provide the feature you chose (e.g., saving an image, recording audio).

The data stays on device unless you actively share it (e.g., export/share sheet).

You can change permissions anytime in Settings ▸ Privacy.

Children’s privacy

Our app is not directed to children under 13. We do not knowingly collect personal data from children. If you believe a child provided personal data, contact us and we’ll delete it.

Security

Because we don’t keep personal data on our servers, our exposure is limited. On-device data is protected by your device’s security (passcode, Face/Touch ID, encryption at rest).

Your rights

If you contact us with a privacy request (access, deletion, questions), we’ll respond promptly—even though we generally don’t hold data about you.

Changes

We may update this policy if the app’s data practices change. We’ll update the “Last updated” date and include changes in the app release notes when relevant.

If you do use analytics/SDKs (delete this section if not applicable)

If you add any of the following, update the policy above and list each provider here:

Analytics (e.g., Firebase/Crashlytics): app usage, diagnostics → purpose: improve stability/features → retention: per provider’s settings → opt-out: disable “Share Analytics” or in-app toggle if provided.
Advertising (e.g., AdMob, Unity Ads): device identifiers for ad delivery/frequency capping → tracking: not enabled unless you allow “Allow Apps to Request to Track” and consent in-app.
Cloud sync/storage (e.g., iCloud): documents or saves you choose to sync to your iCloud account.
Social sign-in/Game Center: only to authenticate and provide platform features.

Be sure your App Store Privacy answers match these practices.

Optional: App Store Privacy Summary (Nutrition Label)

If no data is collected: select “Data Not Collected.”
If you add minimal diagnostics via Crashlytics: mark Diagnostics → Crash data (Not linked, Not used for tracking).
